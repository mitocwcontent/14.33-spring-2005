{{< anchor "Problem_Set" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Problem Set
------------------------------------------------------

There is one problem set ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/14_33_pro_set_v3)) in the class, with an associated data file \[tspsimr7172v2.dta ([DTA]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/tspsimr7172v2))\]. You may find the statistical software package STATA® to be useful in solving the problems. A STATA® tutorial is available in the [study materials]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials) section.

{{< anchor "Research_Paper" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Research Paper
------------------------------------------------------------

The main project will be a paper that should be 10-15 pages of text (12 point Times New Roman with 1 inch margins), plus tables and figures. The paper will report on original economic research that you perform over the course of the semester. There will be a number of opportunities to make presentations on your research throughout the course of the semester.
